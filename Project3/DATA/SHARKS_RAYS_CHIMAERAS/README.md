##Data Summary##

Our dataset contains 1,546 images of 15 shark species. The dataset is sourced from Roboflow’s Shark
Species Dataset (/content/Shark-Species-Dataset-1). The dataset is partitioned into training, validation, and test directories following a conventional supervised image classification 
structure (train/, valid/, test/). Each directory contains subfolders that represent individual shark species classes. The dataset supports our goal of developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of classifying shark species from photographic data and integrating conservation statis metadata for vulnerability analysis.
